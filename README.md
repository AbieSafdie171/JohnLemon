# Description of Project

	John Lemon is trapped in a haunted house and needs to find their way out! Use WASD to move and try and find the exit while avoiding the gargoyles and ghosts, which will restart the game if they catch you! 

	Lerp feature by Abie and Zach
	Dot Product by Angel
	Particle by Jerry

# Lerp

	John Lemon has a pet sphere! It uses lerp to change color, and progressivley turns from blue to red as John gets closer to the exit. However, the pet sphere is not that intelligent and you may have to get "colder" in order to get "warmer".

	The lerp is calculated based on the sum of the x and z position of John divided by the sum of the x and z position of the exit.
